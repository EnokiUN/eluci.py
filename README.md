# eluci.py
A simple TUI for interfacing with the alpha version of Eludris.

## Usage

Using eluci.py is as simple as -you guessed it- running the file!

By default eluci.py uses @ooliver1's instance of Eludris located at 
<https://eludris.tooty.xyz>, you can change that by overriding the 
`REST_URL` and `GATEWAY_URL` environment variables.
